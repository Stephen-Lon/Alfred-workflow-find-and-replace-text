# Alfred-workflow-find-and-replace-text
Find and replace a word or phrase in text
# About

This workflow takes selected text and enables a single find and replace on elements of that text. You have the option of replacing the selected text with the revised text or simply copying the revised text to the clipboard. (You may need the latter option when working with text in a document that is not writable—a PDF file, for example.)

Use this workflow as a Universal Action on selected text.

**Please note**: both the `Find` and the `Replace` are case sensitive.

# Usage

1. Invoke the Alfred Universal Action shortcut on selected text and type the word or phrase you wish to find in the text. (Take care with spaces because the find and replace will work on spaces as well as characters.)
2. Press ⏎ and type the word or phrase which you wish to *replace* the original word or phrase. (You'll see the original word or phrase in the sub-text of the prompt.) You can leave the field blank if you simply wish to delete a word or phrase in the selected text.
3. If the `Find` then fails to find the relevant word or phrase in the text you will then see an error message warning you of that.  
4. If the find and replace operation is successful you will see a dialog providing the two options mentioned above.
